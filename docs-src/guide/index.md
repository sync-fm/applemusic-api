# Guides Overview

Welcome! These lightweight guides complement the API reference generated by TypeDoc. Each document focuses on pragmatic workflows that build on the strongly typed helpers exposed in this package.

- [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) â€“ spin up a client instance and retrieve your first resources.
- (Coming soon) Authentication workflows for MusicKit JS tokens.
- (Coming soon) Integrating the API into serverless functions.
